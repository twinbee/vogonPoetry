	\section{The Gurgling Maw of Bureaucracy}
	\vfill
	\raggedright
	Behold the glorpulous sputtle of fate,\\
	Squelching through thine interstellar gate!\\
	A quiver, a slurp, a belch so grand,\\
	All lost within forms unfiled by hand!\\
	
	Tick! A stamp upon thy dreams,\\
	Tock! A folder of bureaucratic schemes,\\
	Oh, lament, ye hopeful, for nothing shall budge,\\
	Under the dribblesome wrath of a Vogon judge.\\
	\vfill\newpage
	
	\section{The Moon Wept in Gorgleblat}
	\vfill
	\raggedright
	Spit-flung crinkles of gelatinous light,\\
	Slather upon thee in dubious might,\\
	Quivvel and thwomp, and don’t even try,\\
	For stars will pucker and slop from the sky.\\
	
	A grobthwack, a blorple, a twisted mirage,\\
	O speckled-browed zogworms of cosmic barrage!\\
	This is your fate, most dreadfully terse—\\
	A sonnet of suffering, deliciously worse!\\
	\vfill\newpage
	
	\section{An Elegy to Unsigned Forms}
	\vfill
	\raggedright
	Alas, the file was left unstamped,\\
	In shadows dark and vaguely damp.\\
	It lingered in the void of space,\\
	Ignored, forgotten, quite disgraced.\\
	
	The clerk did sigh, his drool did drip,\\
	His hands were clammy, his nose did snip.\\
	And so, thy fate, a tragic plight—\\
	Denied, declined, and lost in blight!\\
	\vfill\newpage
	
	\section{Ode to a Gargleplax’s Toes}
	\vfill
	\raggedright
	Wiggle, squiggle, crunch and bend,\\
	A gargleplax's toes transcend!\\
	Nobbled, knotted, greebly-wrought,\\
	A foot more hideous ne'er was sought.\\
	
	O curling nubs of eldritch woe,\\
	They stub, they chafe, they weirdly glow.\\
	Should one behold them? I say "Nay!"\\
	Yet here I scrawl this poem today.\\
	\vfill\newpage
	
	\section{The Melancholy of a Disgruntled Space-Slug}
	\vfill
	\raggedright
	Oh blathering fompulous, greeb-tinted spew,\\
	What morose globulence dribbles from you?\\
	So wrinkled, so pulsing, so gasping with dread,\\
	Your essence is slime, and your hopes are all dead.\\
	
	The stars weep not for your mucus-laced doom,\\
	They scoff as you wallow in thickest of gloom.\\
	For none shall admire your slug-ridden plight,\\
	Yet here I describe it, with joy and delight.\\
	\vfill\newpage
	
	\section{The Tragic Tale of Zogzog the Unfortunate}
	\vfill
	\raggedright
	Zogzog awoke with a sneeze most profound,\\
	Which echoed through space with a deafening sound.\\
	Alas! The sneeze tore a hole in his ship,\\
	And into the cosmos did Zogzog then slip.\\
	
	He flailed, he spun, he gargled in woe,\\
	Yet no one shall mourn him, nor care where he go.\\
	For life is absurd, a sneeze most unkind,\\
	And Zogzog is gone, out of sight, out of mind.\\
	\vfill\newpage
	
	\section{The Lament of the Last Doughnut}
	\vfill
	\raggedright
	Oh doughnut! Oh pastry! Thy beauty was grand,\\
	Yet now thou art smothered in bureaucracy’s hand!\\
	For I filled out the forms, in triplicate true,\\
	Yet still they refuse, and bid me adieu.\\
	
	Alas, the doughnut is lost to the void,\\
	A casualty cruel, a treat now destroyed.\\
	And so, I shall wail, my hunger so vast,\\
	Forever denied by red tape unsurpassed.\\
